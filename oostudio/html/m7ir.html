		Samplicity has created a new Impulse Response Library, using the immensely popular and highly acclaimed Bricasti M7 reverb unit. And again, Samplicity has created a very complete, accurate and excellently sounding set of impulse responses, all in True Stereo and in Mono-to-Stereo. This library surpasses all previously released Bricasti IRs in terms of signal-to-noise ratios and detailed and rich reverb tails.
