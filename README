OOM2 is developed from the base code of MusE (Muse Sequencer) written by the mighty Werner Schweer, 
and maintained and modified to the present day, by the current Muse2 maintainer Robert Jonsson and his team.

We not only willingly credit Werner for his code, but add our deepest respect and admiration as well.

  =============================
      Requirements
  =============================
      

      - CMake >= 2.4 
        http:/www.cmake.org/HTML/Download.html

      - QT: Qt >= 4.6.0 
        ftp://ftp.trolltech.com/qt/source
        OOMidi does _not_ compile with older versions

      - gcc >= 4.x.x

      - libsndfile >= 1.0.1
        http://www.mega-nerd.com/libsndfile/

      - libsamplerate

      - JACK >= 0.118.0
          http://jackaudio.org/download

      Optional:

      - fluidsynth >= 1.0.3 (formerly known as iiwusynth) from
        http://savannah.nongnu.org/download/fluid

      - OSC (Open Sound Control) 
      - DSSI (Disposable Soft Synth Interface) with support for DSSI vst plugins.
        (Both recommended - DSSI alone will have no DSSI GUIs. OSC alone does nothing, for now.)

      - LASH Audio Session Handler

PLEASE NOTE: We do not use Lash at openoctave, and have not tested it with OOM2.
Your mileage may vary, and we hope you are successful if you wish to use Lash,
but we are working towards using jack-session as our session protocol.
Jack-session is not implemented yet, but is on our long list of intended features. 
      
      - ConTeXt (for building documentation, by default the build
               script tries to build documentation, can be
               disabled by setting ENABLE_DOCUMENTATION to OFF)

  =============================
      Compiling:
  =============================

      - Download source from git://github.com/ccherrett/oom.git

      - Command line to unpack source:
            tar xvofz oom-x.y.z.tar.gz 
         where x.y.z is the version number.
        Or just use a graphical de-compressor to unpack it somewhere.  

      - To compile OOMidi, run the following commands from the 
         top level directory where the source code was unpacked
         (the directory where THIS README FILE is): 
        
          # Create build directory. Choose any name like 'build'.
              mkdir build                                      
          # Enter build directory.
              cd build                                         
          
          # Create make system in the build directory.
          # Optional <Prefix> is the location to install OOMidi, default /usr/local.
          # Build type can be blank (to reset a previous cached type to 'empty'), 
          #  debug, release, RelWithDebInfo and MinSizeRel.
          # If no CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE is given at all, cmake uses either the previous 
          #  cached value, or else 'empty' (plain unoptimized).
          # ('Release' type is recommended, otherwise it builds a plain unoptimized program.)
              cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=release [-DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=<prefix>] ../
          
          # Compile oom
              make                                             
            
      - Install OOMidi:
              Run "make install"  (as root user)

  =============================
      running OOMidi
  =============================

      OOMidi is a realtime program which requires special rights to
      work poperly.
      Recommended setup:

      - check if you are running a sufficiently new linux kernel > 2.6.x

      - create an "audio" group if it does not already exists
        and put yourself into this group

      - make sure you can acces the realtime clock (RTC)
            chmod 660 /dev/rtc
            chgrp audio /dev/rtc

NOTE: Alsa now uses the HPET timer, and adds a symlink for RTC based applications.

      - make sure OOMidi can set the rtc clock:
            echo 8192 > /proc/sys/dev/rtc/max-user-freq
            inspect with:
            cat /proc/sys/dev/rtc/max-user-freq

      - for OOMidi to gain RT priviledges load the "realtime-lsm"
        modul; the modul should be configured to give all "audio"
        group members realtime priviledges

NOTE: the realtime-lsm module is depreciated in later kernel versions.

      - some distros do not load the alsa sequencer module by default.
        if necessary, load the alsa sequencer module with:
            /sbin/modprobe snd-seq

      - start qjackctl
            - start JACK with qjackctl

      - start OOMidi
	       /usr/local/bin/oomidi

      (JACK and all its clients (qjackctl & OOMidi) must run with the
      same user id)


For Gentoo users: When building your kernel, Gentoo recommends you build alsa directly into the kernel.
In our testing, this has proved more stable than building alsa as modules. 


  =============================
      known bugs
  =============================

The DSSI plugins are installed and stored on your system by you, the users. Some behave well, some not quite so well.
These plugins are a challenge so far:

Less trivialsynth
Trivial synth.



      - many
