  =============================
      Requirements
  =============================
      

      - CMake >= 2.4 
        http:/www.cmake.org/HTML/Download.html

      - QT: Qt >= 4.2.0 
        ftp://ftp.trolltech.com/qt/source
        OOMidi does _not_ compile with older versions

      - gcc >= 4.x.x

      - libsndfile >= 1.0.1
        http://www.mega-nerd.com/libsndfile/

      - libsamplerate

      - JACK >= 0.103
          http://jackit.sourceforge.net/download/

      Optional:

      - fluidsynth >= 1.0.3 (formerly known as iiwusynth) from
        http://savannah.nongnu.org/download/fluid

      - OSC (Open Sound Control) 
      - DSSI (Disposable Soft Synth Interface) with support for DSSI vst plugins.
        (Both recommended - DSSI alone will have no DSSI GUIs. OSC alone does nothing, for now.)

      - LASH Audio Session Handler
      
      - ConTeXt (for building documentation, by default the build
               script tries to build documentation, can be
               disabled by setting ENABLE_DOCUMENTATION to OFF)

  =============================
      Compiling:
  =============================

      - Download source from https://github.com/ccherrett/oom

      - Command line to unpack source:
            tar xvofz oom-x.y.z.tar.gz 
         where x.y.z is the version number.
        Or just use a graphical de-compressor to unpack it somewhere.  

      - To compile OOMidi, run the following commands from the 
         top level directory where the source code was unpacked
         (the directory where THIS README FILE is): 
        
          # Create build directory. Choose any name like 'build'.
              mkdir build                                      
          # Enter build directory.
              cd build                                         
          
          # Create make system in the build directory.
          # Optional <Prefix> is the location to install OOMidi, default /usr/local.
          # Build type can be blank (to reset a previous cached type to 'empty'), 
          #  debug, release, RelWithDebInfo and MinSizeRel.
          # If no CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE is given at all, cmake uses either the previous 
          #  cached value, or else 'empty' (plain unoptimized).
          # ('Release' type is recommended, otherwise it builds a plain unoptimized program.)
              cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=release [-DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=<prefix>] ../
          
          # Compile oom
              make                                             
            
      - Install OOMidi:
              Run "make install"  (as root user)

  =============================
      running OOMidi
  =============================

      OOMidi is a realtime program which requires special rights to
      work poperly.
      Recommended setup:

      - check if you are running a sufficiently new linux kernel > 2.6.x

      - create an "audio" group if it does not already exists
        and put yourself into this group

      - make sure you can acces the realtime clock (RTC)
            chmod 660 /dev/rtc
            chgrp audio /dev/rtc

      - make sure OOMidi can set the rtc clock:
            echo 8192 > /proc/sys/dev/rtc/max-user-freq
            inspect with:
            cat /proc/sys/dev/rtc/max-user-freq

      - for OOMidi to gain RT priviledges load the "realtime-lsm"
        modul; the modul should be configured to give all "audio"
        group members realtime priviledges

      - some distros do not load the alsa sequencer module by default.
        if necessary, load the alsa sequencer module with:
            /sbin/modprobe snd-seq

      - start qjackctl
            - start JACK with qjackctl

      - start OOMidi
	       /usr/local/bin/oom2

      (JACK and all its clients (qjackctl & OOMidi) must run with the
      same user id)


  =============================
      known bugs

      - many
