Major redesign work. 
Fixed some behavioural quirks in the PR
Drawing issues in the PR controller lanes now seem to be fixed. There'll be a likely increase in CPU use. Needs testing, and monitoring.
New icon set for main items now in place. (woohoo)
Updated and added more shortcuts. Playback cursor in the PR will now jump to the active note. (Ctrl +Space) Step input now has a toggle shortcut (Ctrl + F8)
